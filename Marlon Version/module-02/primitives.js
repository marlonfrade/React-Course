//   Reference and Primitive Types Refresher

// By Using const, we can reassign a value like below
const number = 1;
const num2 = number;

console.log(num2);

//Now numbers, strings, booleans, these are so-called primitive types whenever you reassign or you store
// a variable in another variable.
// It will copy the value, objects and arrays are reference types.
